<p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about
			 an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies
			 of <em>Nature</em>, <em>New Scientist</em>, and all
			 the other scientific journals her work had
			 appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <cite>On
			 The Road</cite>. It had been <strong>Molly's</strong> favorite book
			 since college, and the longer she spent in these
			 four walls the more she felt she needed to be
			 free.</p>
		 <p>She had spent the last ten years in this room,
			 sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote
			 proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of
			 people who have nothing better to do</q>. Although
			 many considered her pioneering work, unraveling
			 the secrets of the llama <abbr
			 title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>, to be an
			 outstanding achievement, Molly <em>did</em> think
			 she had something better to do.</p>
